# Hi There, I'm Colby.

I am currently studying Computer Science at Boise State University here in Boise, ID. I am envisioning this blog to be the struggles I face during projects and how I solved them. My current dream job is to work for Nintendo of America, and so I will be working on developing my Graphics, Game Programming, and C/C++ skills throughout this blog. The first project I am going to make is a Pong clone using OpenGL. Stay tuned for more updates on future projects.

Now, I am using a template for this blog so that I can effortlessly type my content and focus the majority of my efforts into coding these projects up.
