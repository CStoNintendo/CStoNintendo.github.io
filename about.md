# Hi There, I'm Colby.

I am currently studying Computer Science at Boise State University here in Boise, ID. I envision this blog to be the struggles I face during game dev projects and how I solve them. My current dream job is to work for Nintendo of America, and so I will be working on developing my Graphics, Game Programming, and general programming skills throughout.

If you have a suggestion for a project I could do, shoot me an email at colbyjayallen@gmail.com.
