# Hi There, I'm Colby.

I am currently studying Computer Science at Boise State University here in Boise, ID. I started this blog to help document my journey as a "developing" developer as I tackle different programming projects that I find interest in.

The name of my blog CStoNintendo represents the range of programming I want to showcase throughout. Everything from boring (but extremely essential) Computer Science knowledge to Machine Learning to Blockchain/Cryptocurrency to Game Programming (that's where the Nintendo comes in).

So come along for the ride as we plan, write, debug and bang our heads against the wall together. Nobody said that coding was easier, just that the finished product would be worth it.
