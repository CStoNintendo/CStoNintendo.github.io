## Hello all and welcome to my Game Development Blog.

As I wrote in the about column, I will be using this blog as a place to document my journey as a Software Engineer and I am hoping to highlight the progress that I make along the way. 

The first game I intend to clone is the 1972 classic [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong). Now, even if you haven't played this game, you have at least heard about it or seen a video of someone else playing it. From a high level, the game is extremely simple and from the surface level looks like it will be rather simple to implement, but we will see. 

For the first few simple games I recreate, I am wanting to use only a Rendering Engine, which will force me to build a simple game engine around it. This will include: collision detection, music/sound effects, and possibly even animations. Now, from what I have read, people seem to call this very foolish for actually making a game, but a great exercise for people who want to know how Game Engines work under the hood at a much Lower Level.

My next blog post will be my plan of attack on how I will tackle creating this game. Please stay tuned for more updates.
