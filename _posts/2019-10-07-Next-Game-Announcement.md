Hello all, I wanted to make a blog post and announce what I am going to start working on next for CStoNintendo. This past week was quite a busy one with 3 coding projects due and a Linear Algebra test all in the same week, but I have quite a few life changes coming up. I will be starting an internship here shortly at Boise State University for the World Museum that is currently being built in the new Fine Arts building, it will be a very exciting opportunity and I am very excited to begin.

### An Update as Well as Some Gushing Over a Gameplay Mechanic I Really Enjoy

Anyways, when thinking about the most primitive forms of video games, it is very easy to jump to Pong. But, now that I have completed that, finding out where to jump to next has been quite a bit difficult. Do I make a primitive RPG like a Dragon Quest? Or perhaps a 2D platformer like Mario? 

When I think about what I believe to be the most fun I've had in video games, I would probably turn to the turn based combat of the Paper Mario / Mario & Luigi RPG series. While the combat is turn based, it is not a static playstyle where you simply wait after selecting your actions to act again as happens in traditional RPGs. In these Mario RPGs, when you select your attack, you must also time a button press with the action to deal extra damage to your enemy. And that isn't all, you also can defend against enemy attacks using this same method.

As soon as Mario lands on the tentacle, the play must press the A button.

This style of combat keeps the player constantly engaged in the game, as new enemies are quickly introduced which force you to be continually shuffling your play style. Now this style of combat has been mimicked by other games, most notably would probably be the South Park: The Stick of Truth which contained "Prompt-Enhanced" combat albeit in much more whimsical and low-brow humor ways.

Command prompt that will allow the user to defend using the "A" button.

I believe that this mechanic being included in RPGs was a giant step forward for the industry and whenever someone is playing games that use this mechanic, they will surely be transfixed on the combat.

### What Game are We Making Next?!

I have been going back and forth on whether or not to use a game engine like Godot or Unity for this next project or to do it using a primitive rendering engine instead.. I believe that using a primitive rendering engine for at least one more project would be very beneficial for continuing to learn, so I will be doing that. I think that a fun game to take a stab at next would be the 1984 world known classic....... Tetris! I will be making this game using PIXIjs as well, so anyone will be able to play without having to download and compile anything.

Coming Soon I will be posting my plan on how I will go about attackign this beast. Which I will be sticking more closely to than my first, because I already have a level of comfort with using Javascript.

Thanks for reading!
