### Life and Career Updates

Hello my avid readers, I know that it has been close to 8 months since the last time I wrote a blog post, and for that I apologize. A lot has changed, and I'm going to use this post to update what has been going on in my life and career as of lately. Hold on tight.


#### Schooling

For flexibility, I decided to drop out of Boise State University and begin an online Computer Science degree that will allow me to be in more control of my time. I was having to leave work to attend lectures and take exams, so I was unable to technically be full-time based on how much time I was spending at BSU (not including all of the time out of class that I was having to be spending on projects). I started at Western Governor's University this past March and it has been a wonderful fit for me and my family. I am able to breeze through classes at whatever pace I choose, which makes my tuition dollars stretch their value quite a bit. Makes me think these brick and mortar universities might be a thing of the past in not too much time...


#### Job/Career

Starting in November 2019, I took a job with a healthcare IT company called Kno2 that does a whole lot of cool things in the healthcare ecosystem ([You can see my blurb on their career page](https://kno2.com/careers/)). For people that know me, this seems to truly be a match made in heaven. I always wanted to become a Physician, but after the news that my wife was pregnant with our first child, I decided that I didn't want to dedicate so many years of my life to becoming one. I always wanted to be a father first and foremost (and a good one at that), so I switched my college major to Computer Science thinking that there was most likely a job market and I would be able to provide for my family. Fast forward from Summer of 2017 to now, and it seems I made the right choice.

At my current job, I work on backend work using C# and the .NET Framework and help out in the frontend by using the Angular Javascript framework. I currently have only worked their for roughly 7 months, but in that short time I have learned more about software development than all of my CS classes combined. Everything just makes a whole lot more sense now, not sure how to properly explain it, but every CS student should get an internship and soak up as much as they possibly can from it. Aside from the pure software development, I also am learning how to use Microsoft Azure and how cloud technologies are used.

I am extremely happy in my current position, and was promoted from Intern to Junior Developer in only 6 months time. It is fun to look back on previous projects I've made and see how much I have grown in less then a years time... But that is to be expected!


#### Family Update

My wife and I welcomed our second child into the world this past January. That was a big part of the motivation to move to online school, and it has payed off already. Having two children under two years old is quite a struggle and has been difficult. Any of the coding time that I get has been in the nights while everyone is sleeping, which is a blessing and a curse. Curse because my free time has been restrained to subsistence levels, but a blessing as since my time is so constrained I get to plan in advance and savor this time even more. 


#### CStoNintendo Update

I don't think that graphics work and game development is the career for me, but I still want to pursue making games as my hobby project. I know that I promised it quite some time ago.... But Tetris is still coming, don't you worry. And it will be written in Rust. Stay tuned.
